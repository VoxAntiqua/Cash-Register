Cash Register simulates a cash register in which various amounts of denominations are stored in a reassignable array called cid (cash in drawer). The user inputs a cash amount, and Cash Register returns the amount of each denomination to give back for exact change, as well as updating the contents of the drawer. If exact change was given, not enough cash remains in the drawer, or the amount paid is less than the price, Cash Register will indicate this.
One of the challenges in developing this was the issue of floating-point precision in JavaScript; repeated arithmetic operations caused variables to drift away from their expected values. To remedy this, I used a helper function to round every float value to 2-decimal accuracy. Outside of the context of an exercise, it would have also been possible to use a library like BigNumber, or perform all operations on integers, using cents as a base unit.
This was developed as an exercise for freeCodeCamp.org's JavaScript course.
